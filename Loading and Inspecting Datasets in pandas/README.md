# 📂 Loading and Inspecting Datasets in pandas

This notebook demonstrates how to load and inspect datasets using the `pandas` library in Python. It is part of my learning from the Microsoft Data Analysis and Visualization with Python course on Coursera.

---

## 📌 How It Works

- Loads datasets from CSV files using `pandas.read_csv()`.
- Displays the first few and last few rows of the dataset using `.head()` and `.tail()`.
- Inspects data types, column names, and basic dataset structure.
- Uses methods like `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.shape`, and `.columns` to understand the dataset.

## 🚀 My Learning Goals

- Learn how to load datasets from files using pandas.
- Understand how to inspect and summarize data before analysis.
- Build a strong foundation for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
